\title{Calculate Hofmann Factor Complexity Index for columns/factors}
\usage{
HofmannFac(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} containing the factor loadings. Rows represent items, and columns represent factors in the factorial model.
The values in the matrix should be factor loadings.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing one column:
\itemize{
\item \code{Choff}: The Hofman factor complexity index for each factor, ranging from 1 (1 significant item) to p (maximum number of items in the matrix).
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Hofmann complexity index (\code{Choff}) for each factor (column) in a factor loading matrix.
The index estimates the factorial complexity at the factor level, indicating how many items contribute significantly to each factor.
}
\details{
The index ranges from 1 (indicating a factor with a single item) to p (the total number of \strong{items} in the factor, indicating the number of items involved in the definition of the factor).
The formula for the index is based on summing squared and quartic factor loadings, similar to the original Hofmann (1977) method applied to the factor (column) dimension.
In this case, when calculating the complexity at the factor level, we assess how many items significantly contribute to each
factor. In a latent dimension with known structure, the resulting value should be equal or close to the number of items expected in this dimension. Values different from the expected
number of items suggests there are items with significant loadings or items close to or in the hyperplane. As more items contribute to the factor,
the value of \strong{Choff} increases, reaching p (the number of items) when all items significantly contribute to the factor.

Hofmanâ€™s complexity index for factors evaluates how many items contribute to the definition of each factor. A value close to 1 indicates that a factor is well-defined by only one item (unidimensional), while values closer to p indicate higher complexity.

The formula is based on the sum of squared and quartic factor loadings, and the result is normalized so that higher complexity values suggest factors defined by multiple items.
