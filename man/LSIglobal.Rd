\title{LSIglobal: Loading Simplicity Index (Lorenzo-Seva, 2003)}
\usage{
LSIglobal(loadings)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadings}{A numeric matrix or data frame of factor loadings. Rows represent items,
columns represent factors.}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the global simplicity of the solution.
}
\description{
Computes the Loading Simplicity Index (LSI) as proposed by Lorenzo-Seva (2003),
adapted from the implementation in \code{lazy.fa::LS_index}. This global index
evaluates the overall factorial simplicity of a loading matrix using a non-linear
weighting scheme to emphasize dominant factor loadings.
}
\details{
The LSI reflects the extent to which the factor solution exhibits simple structure.
It applies a double normalization to the loading matrix and then computes a non-linear
function over the squared normalized loadings. High values (close to 1) indicate
greater factorial simplicity, while lower values (close to 0) reflect more diffuse or
complex loading patterns.

The index is scaled to the interval \link{0, 1} as follows:
\deqn{
LSI = \frac{w - e}{1 - e}
}
where \eqn{w} is the weighted average complexity across all loadings, and \eqn{e} is
the theoretical minimum expected under uniform distribution of loadings.

L <- matrix(c(
  0.6, 0.2,
  0.5, 0.3,
  0.1, 0.7
