\title{Hofmann Index of Factorial Complexity and its Normalized Inverse}
\usage{
Hofmann(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric data frame or matrix of factor loadings, where rows represent items
and columns represent factors. Factor loadings are typically between -1 and 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Hoff}: Hofmann's original complexity coefficient for each item.
\item \code{Hoff_R}: The inverse of \code{Hoff}, representing factorial simplicity in \link{0, 1}.
}
}
\description{
Computes Hofmann’s (1977) coefficient of factorial complexity for each item
in a factor loading matrix, along with a normalized inverse version rescaled between 0 and 1.
}
\details{
The original Hofmann index (\code{Hoff}) quantifies the extent to which an item loads
on multiple factors. It ranges from 1 (perfect factorial simplicity, i.e., loading only
on one factor) to \eqn{p} (maximum complexity, where the item loads equally on all \eqn{p} factors).

The modified version, \code{Hoff_R}, is the reciprocal of \code{Hoff}, resulting in a simplicity index
normalized to the interval \link{0, 1}. Higher values of \code{Hoff_R} indicate greater factorial simplicity.

The Hofmann complexity index is computed as:
\deqn{Hoff_i = \frac{(\sum_j \lambda_{ij}^2)^2}{\sum_j \lambda_{ij}^4}}
where \eqn{\lambda_{ij}} is the loading of item \eqn{i} on factor \eqn{j}.

The rescaled index \code{Hoff_R} is computed as \code{1 / Hoff}, and provides a
bounded indicator of simplicity (closer to 1 means simpler structure).

These indices are particularly useful when comparing items in terms of their factorial clarity,
and complement other measures such as Bentler’s or Fleming’s simplicity indices.
