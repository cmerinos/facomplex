\title{Profile of Factorial Complexity}
\usage{
profileFacomplex(loadings, target, abs = TRUE, cutoff = NULL, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadings}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of factor loadings. Rows are items and columns are factors.}

\item{target}{A named list, where each name corresponds to a factor in \code{loadings}, and each element is a character vector of item names (matching the row names of \code{loadings}) assigned as target to that factor.}

\item{abs}{Logical. Should absolute values of loadings be used? Default is TRUE.}

\item{cutoff}{Optional numeric. If defined, reports the percentage of cross-loadings ≤ and > this value.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to round the output. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A data.frame in long format: each row corresponds to a statistic and each column to a factor.
}
\description{
Computes descriptive statistics of factor loadings per factor, distinguishing between target and cross-loadings.
Optionally, reports the percentage of cross-loadings below and above a user-defined cutoff.
}
\details{
The function returns a data.frame where:
\itemize{
\item Each row corresponds to a summary statistic.
\item Each column (after the first) corresponds to a factor defined in \code{target}.
}

The following statistics are computed per factor:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Mean.Target, Median.Target, SD.Target}: Central tendency and dispersion of loadings on the target factor.
\item \strong{Min.Target, Max.Target}: Minimum and maximum of the target loadings.
\item \strong{Mean.Cross, Median.Cross, SD.Cross}: Descriptive statistics of cross-loadings (i.e., loadings on non-target factors).
\item \strong{Min.Cross, Max.Cross}: Minimum and maximum of the cross-loadings.
\item \strong{Perc.Cross.≤.cutoff, Perc.Cross.>.cutoff}: If \code{cutoff} is specified, these show the percentage of cross-loadings ≤ or > that threshold.
\item \strong{n.Items}: Number of items assigned to each factor.
}

This orientation (statistics in rows, factors in columns) facilitates interpretation and avoids excessively wide tables when the number of factors is large.
